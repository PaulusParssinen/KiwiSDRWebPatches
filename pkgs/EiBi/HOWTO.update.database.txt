Procedure for updating to a new EiBi database release from eibispace.de

CAUTION:
After much confusion figured out how downloading from eibispace.de will break the file UTF-8 encoding.
Underlying cause is not understood. In browser DO NOT use right-click "download linked file" function.
Instead, use the wget/iconv combination shown. Multiple browsers have this same issue.

Download .csv and README.TXT files as follows.
Change Makefile:ABYY to whatever is current on eibispace.de webpage (e.g. "b24")
Run "make fetch"
Verify grep output to make sure correct accented chars: 690;0000-2400;;B;R치dio Clube do Par치;P;B;be;1;;

Added ALE back manually (from A21) using BBedit:
Makefile does "cat eibi.csv ALE.kiwi.csv > sked-current.csv"
Sort sked-current.csv file by freq:
	Text > Apply text transform > Sort lines
		> Configure (numbers match by value; sort using pattern; type:"[0-9.]+;" entire match; OK)
		> THEN SELECT THE SINGLE FILE WITH: Apply to: > Choose > open text documents > (drop down) > select sked-current.csv
		    SELECTION IS TRICKY HERE W/ LATEST BBEDIT. DOUBLE CHECK FILENAME!!!
            *** otherwise it will apply to the file last time sort was done!
            *** make sure multiple files are not selected!
      > Apply
		> Put back top header line (the one beginning with "kHz:")
			It gets incorrectly sorted a few dozen lines down the list
			If this _isn't_ true then sort may have not worked!

make run (mr)
Will update dx/EiBi.h file
Check that "R치dio Clube do Par치" appears correctly in EiBi.h

openwebrx.js:dx.db_s: "EiBi-[AB]yy" string will be automatically updated now.
